"""
A python package to easily represent metabolism as an ensemble of reactions
which describe transformations of compounds. It aims to provide intuitive
interfaces using L{Metabolism} objects in flux balance analysis (FBA),
statistics (random), graph theory (graph_view), and in connecting metabolism
with transcription data (PDA).
